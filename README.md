# Youtube to Spotify
 Uses youtube and spotify API to convert a user's liked videos on Youtube into a spotify playlist. 

# Errors
This program is definitely something I want to evolve when I have more time. It is currently very buggy and only will work if a user only has valid music in their "liked videos" list on Youtube. This is because when I send a request to Youtube for video data such as "artist", it will look into Youtube Music and grab the data using Youtube Music. If it is not availible on their, the request currently fails as I have yet to find a work around.
